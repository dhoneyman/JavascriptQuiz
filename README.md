# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Your Task

The following is my American history of rock climbing quiz built with Javascript! The answer to each question corresponds to the question number. For example, the answer the question one is the first listed answer, the answer to the second question is the second listed answer and so forth. The score presented on the final page is the number of questions the player got correct. I hope to someday use the remaining time as a multiplier on that number. Hope you enjoy!
